# Portfolio


## Description
This is verision one of my Portfolio, written using HTML & CSS only. I built these webpages to grow my knowledge and understanding of the above two languages and how to use them to format. 


## Limitations
As this is my first homework assignment for my coding bootcamp, there are limitations I was working around. 

1. No projects completed yet.
    * The projects listed on the portfolio page do not link to actual projects at this time. Future versions will have that capability as projects are completed. 
1. No database knowledge yet.
    * We have not covered databases yet in our bootcamp. Thus the contact page will error if someone attempts to submit a message. Future verions will have the capability to actally contact me through the webpage.
1. Limited understanding of formatting.
    * I learned a lot about formatting via CSS through this project. However, that led to some inconsistencies throughout the code as I was working on a different principle or element. In future versions, as I learn better formatting practices and am able to use other tools like bootstrap, I hope to have more consistent code. I also plan on formatting all the pages so they are more responsive to various devices. 


## Sucesses
1. Flexbox
    * I learned a lot about flex-box. This was one of the more time-consuming elements because it required a lot of research. See below for a couple of helpful tutorials. 
1. About Me Page
    * I did some research on how to write an about me page. Although I am not quite satisfied, I believe I have a great draft to build upon. 
1. Organization
    * Good habits take a lot of work to form, but bad habits can take more work to break. So I'm working on my organizational habits now. One of our TA's for the class, Noah Yasskin, helped me with my organization - particularly pertaining to classes. I also think my organization of my CSS stylesheets is well done. As I work more on responsiveness, I think I will better utilize the sheets specific to each html page.
